## Simple SNMP Manager### InformationsProject is easily extendable by providing the handlers for other types that derive from the Entity class.### Limitations- Packet serializer only accepts packets that have length of 255 or lower, as it can decode and encode only one byte for the length.- Octet string is serializing everything as a string, which may lead to the not-printable characters in the terminal or other output### Files- types.cpp/h- SNMPClient.cpp/h- SNMPPacket.cpp/h- InterfaceInfoContainer.cpp/h
